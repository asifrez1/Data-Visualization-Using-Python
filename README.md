Performance Analysis of Top European Soccer Teams Using Some Advanced Analytics

Scoring a goal may decide the winner in a soccer match, but it does not always tell us who played better. With some advanced statistics, it is possible to measure the quality of team by analyzing the chances created and conceded. The aim of this project is to highlight some other aspects of a teamsâ€™ performance apart from goals scored, to understand which teams are better and why.
